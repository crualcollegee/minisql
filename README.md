# MiniSQL


本框架参考CMU-15445 BusTub框架进行改写，在保留了缓冲池、索引、记录模块的一些核心设计理念的基础上，做了一些修改和扩展，使之兼容于原MiniSQL实验指导的要求。
以下列出了改动/扩展较大的几个地方：
- 对Disk Manager模块进行改动，扩展了位图页、磁盘文件元数据页用于支持持久化数据页分配回收状态；
- 在Record Manager, Index Manager, Catalog Manager等模块中，通过对内存对象的序列化和反序列化来持久化数据；
- 对Record Manager层的一些数据结构（`Row`、`Field`、`Schema`、`Column`等）和实现进行重构；
- 对Catalog Manager层进行重构，支持持久化并为Executor层提供接口调用;
- 扩展了Parser层，Parser层支持输出语法树供Executor层调用；

此外还涉及到很多零碎的改动，包括源代码中部分模块代码的调整，测试代码的修改，性能上的优化等，在此不做赘述。


注意：为了避免代码抄袭，请不要将自己的代码发布到任何公共平台中。

### 编译&开发环境
- Apple clang version: 11.0+ (MacOS)，使用`gcc --version`和`g++ --version`查看
- gcc & g++ : 8.0+ (Linux)，使用`gcc --version`和`g++ --version`查看
- cmake: 3.20+ (Both)，使用`cmake --version`查看
- gdb: 7.0+ (Optional)，使用`gdb --version`查看
- flex & bison (暂时不需要安装，但如果需要对SQL编译器的语法进行修改，需要安装）
- llvm-symbolizer (暂时不需要安装)
    - in mac os `brew install llvm`, then set path and env variables.
    - in centos `yum install devtoolset-8-libasan-devel libasan`

### 构建
#### Windows
目前该代码暂不支持在Windows平台上的编译。但在Win10及以上的系统中，可以通过安装WSL（Windows的Linux子系统）来进行
开发和构建。WSL请选择Ubuntu子系统（推荐Ubuntu20及以上）。如果你使用Clion作为IDE，可以在Clion中配置WSL从而进行调试，具体请参考
[Clion with WSL](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2018/01/clion-and-linux-toolchain-on-windows-are-now-friends/)

#### MacOS & Linux & WSL
基本构建命令
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```
若不涉及到`CMakeLists`相关文件的变动且没有新增或删除`.cpp`代码（通俗来说，就是只是对现有代码做了修改）
则无需重新执行`cmake..`命令，直接执行`make -j`编译即可。

默认以`debug`模式进行编译，如果你需要使用`release`模式进行编译：
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

### 测试
在构建后，默认会在`build/test`目录下生成`minisql_test`的可执行文件，通过`./minisql_test`即可运行所有测试。

如果需要运行单个测试，例如，想要运行`lru_replacer_test.cpp`对应的测试文件，可以通过`make lru_replacer_test`
命令进行构建。

## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Already a pro? Just edit this README.md and make it your own. Want to make it easy? [Use the template at the bottom](#editing-this-readme)!

## Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/git/add_files/#add-files-to-a-git-repository) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://git.zju.edu.cn/db2025/minisql.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Integrate with your tools

- [ ] [Set up project integrations](https://git.zju.edu.cn/db2025/minisql/-/settings/integrations)

## Collaborate with your team

- [ ] [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/)
- [ ] [Create a new merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)
- [ ] [Automatically close issues from merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically)
- [ ] [Enable merge request approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/)
- [ ] [Set auto-merge](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/auto_merge/)

## Test and Deploy

Use the built-in continuous integration in GitLab.

- [ ] [Get started with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/)
- [ ] [Analyze your code for known vulnerabilities with Static Application Security Testing (SAST)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/)
- [ ] [Deploy to Kubernetes, Amazon EC2, or Amazon ECS using Auto Deploy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/requirements.html)
- [ ] [Use pull-based deployments for improved Kubernetes management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/)
- [ ] [Set up protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html)

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
